This is what happens if #include <stdio.h> is removed:

The compiler will complain during the **compilation** step.

Typical error:
"warning: implicit declaration of function 'printf'"

Because the compiler has no idea what printf is. It guesses it returns an int, which is wrong.

If you ignore the warning, the program might link but printf will print garbage or crash at runtime.
