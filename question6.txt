Fixed the bad variable names:

int 1value = 10;        -> int value1 = 10;     // can't start with number
float avg-rate = 12.5;  -> float avg_rate = 12.5; // no hyphen allowed
char Class = 'A';       -> char student_class = 'A'; // better name, avoids confusion

Rules broken:
- First character must be letter or _
- Only letters, numbers, _ after
- Can't use - or start with digit
